# Browser Cache Clearing Instructions

## The Issue
Your site is working perfectly (as evidenced by it working in incognito mode), but your regular browser is showing cached content from when there were configuration issues.

## Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Fastest)
- **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`
- This forces the browser to reload everything fresh

### Option 2: Clear Cache for Your Domain
1. Open Developer Tools (`F12`)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Option 3: Clear All Browser Cache
**Chrome:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` on Mac)
2. Select "All time" for time range
3. Check "Cached images and files"
4. Click "Clear data"

**Firefox:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Everything" for time range
3. Check "Cache"
4. Click "Clear Now"

**Safari:**
1. Press `Cmd + Option + E`
2. Or go to Develop > Empty Caches

### Option 4: Use Incognito/Private Mode
- This always works because it doesn't use cached content
- **Chrome**: `Ctrl + Shift + N`
- **Firefox**: `Ctrl + Shift + P`
- **Safari**: `Cmd + Shift + N`

## Why This Happened
1. Your browser cached the old broken version
2. The fixes are deployed and working
3. Incognito mode bypasses cache, so it shows the working version
4. Regular browsing mode still shows cached broken content

## Verification
After clearing cache, both of these should work:
- https://transitionmarketingai.com (redirects to www)
- https://www.transitionmarketingai.com (main site)

The site is actually working perfectly now! ðŸŽ‰
